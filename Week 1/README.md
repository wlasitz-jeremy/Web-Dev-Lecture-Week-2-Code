## To do List

Minecraft is an exploration game that can be played so many different ways. The way to so called beat the game is to mine and collect items. You would then have the ability to travel through dimensions to the End and kill the Ender Dragon.

To do so you need eyes of ender to activate the end portal. To craft those you need ender pearls and blaze rods which you can both get in a third dimension called the nether. You generally want decent armour and tools to enter this dimension or else you will die. If you die you will be transported back to the worlds spawn which cannot be changed. The sun dipped behind the jagged mountains, casting long shadows over the village of Blockspire. Lanterns flickered to life along cobblestone streets, but one remained dark—the Great Lantern at the heart of the village. Legend said it was lit by the first settlers, its flame never meant to go out. Yet tonight, it had vanished.

Elyra, a young builder with a knack for redstone, volunteered to find the missing flame. Armed with an iron sword, a stack of torches, and a loaf of bread, she ventured into the Whispering Caves. The air was damp, and the sound of dripping water echoed through the tunnels. Strange markings on the walls hinted at an ancient presence, something older than the village itself.

Deep within the cave, Elyra discovered a hidden chamber glowing with faint blue light. In the center stood a pedestal, and atop it rested the flame—encased in a crystal, guarded by a silent Enderman. She knew she couldnt fight it head-on, so she crafted a quick distraction: a redstone-powered piston trap. With a flick of a lever, the Enderman was teleported away, and Elyra reclaimed the flame.

By dawn, the Great Lantern burned once more, its warm light spilling across Blockspire. The villagers cheered, and Elyra smiled, knowing that in Minecraft, every adventure—no matter how small—could become a legend.
